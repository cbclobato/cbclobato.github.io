*Cannabis* has quickly emerged as a prominent player in both the food and nutraceutical markets, particularly in Europe and the USA. As its popularity continues to grow, farmers face new challenges in producing high-quality *Cannabis* that involve production stability, resource efficiency, and precise cannabinoid profiles.

Recent studies suggest that microorganisms naturally found in plant seeds could offer a promising alternative to chemical fertilizers. These beneficial microbes not only enhance agricultural productivity but also support healthier plants and soils. Despite their potential, *Cannabis* seed endophytes—microorganisms that live within the plant tissues—have been little explored, and no practical applications have been developed for their use in *Cannabis* production. 

This project will identify key endophytes in various *Cannabis* genotypes via advanced multidisciplinary techniques, and investigate the use of a fully biodegradable hydrous polymer to deliver these beneficial microbes into cultivation systems. The ultimate goal is to create an innovative, bio-based product that improves microbial diversity in *Cannabis* farming, showcasing broader agricultural benefits in the process. The use of *Cannabis* seed endophytes presents an exciting new biotechnological solution to meet the growing global demand for *Cannabis* products, offering a sustainable approach to cultivation that could transform the industry.

**Funding:** The *Cannabiom* project, short for *Combination of Endophytes with functional Biopolymers (HydroDots) for improved Cannabis cultivation* was funded by the The Austrian Research Promotion Agency ([FFG](https://projekte.ffg.at/projekt/3970250)) in the frame of the Bridge program (32nd Call for Proposals Bridge 1), together with HydroUnity QLabs GmbH, with the duration of 37 months.
