Seed-associated microorganisms contribute to plant health by influencing nutrient acquisition, disease resistance, and stress adaptation. Culturing microbes is an essential step in microbiome research, allowing for direct functional analysis and potential agricultural applications. However, not all microbes can be readily cultured in laboratory settings, limiting our understanding of their ecological roles. In our latest study, we compared the cultured and uncultured bacterial fractions of _Cannabis_ seeds, shedding light on the factors that determine which microbes can be grown in the lab and which remain elusive. 

To investigate which bacteria could be recovered from _Cannabis_ seeds, we worked with 54 _Cannabis_ accessions, employing both standard and plant-based media, including those supplemented with _Cannabis_ extracts, which aimed at optimizing the growth of slow-growing and highly adapted bacterial taxa. Through this approach, we successfully cultivated bacteria from 36 genera within the five major existing classes in _Cannabis_ seeds: Gammaproteobacteria, Bacilli, Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidia. Despite representing only 6.3% of the total microbial diversity detected in the seeds, these cultured bacteria accounted for 89.2% of the overall microbial abundance. This means that while we can recover many of the dominant bacterial groups, the true extent of microbial diversity within _Cannabis_ seeds remains largely unattainable.

Culture-based methods revealed that a subset of the microbial community, consisting of nearly 60% of the bacterial taxa detected by sequencing, had no close cultured relatives. This included many rare and functionally significant bacteria, such as members of Acidobacteriae and Verrucomicrobiae. These groups are known to play critical roles in plant growth and nutrient cycling, yet their presence in seeds has been largely unexplored.

**Do Microbial Interactions Have a Role in Culturability?**

To further investigate why some microbes remain uncultured despite of their abundance, we conducted a network analyses based on bacterial co-occurrence patterns. The results revealed that uncultured seed bacteria tend to be more central within the microbial network, exhibiting strong connections mainly to other uncultured taxa. This suggests that interspecies interactions — such as nutrient exchange or signaling mechanisms — may play a crucial role in determining whether a microbe can grow independently.

This study highlights the limitations of current culturing methods but also provides a framework for improving microbial isolation strategies. Our findings suggest that microbial culturability is strongly influenced by ecological interactions, not just individual metabolic traits. The proposed implications are expected to be extended beyond _Cannabis_ research. Seeds from diverse plant species likely harbor similarly complex microbial communities, with critical yet uncultured members influencing plant health. By refining cultivation techniques and leveraging microbial interactions, we may be able to recover missing bacterial taxa with potential applications in plant health and disease resistance.

<!-- Defining the Hidden Bacterial Fraction of Cannabis Seeds -->

<!-- Supported by research at the Institute of Environmental Biotechnology at TU Graz, I am investigating the distinction between cultured and uncultured bacterial fractions in Cannabis sativa seeds. While metagenomic approaches have expanded our understanding of microbial diversity, many seed-associated bacteria remain uncultured, limiting our ability to assess their ecological roles and potential agricultural applications. My work aims to identify which bacterial taxa can be recovered through culturing from Cannabis seeds and uncovering the factors that influence microbial culturability.

Seeds serve as microbial reservoirs, transmitting beneficial bacteria across plant generations. These microbes contribute to plant health by promoting growth, enhancing nutrient uptake, and providing protection against pathogens. However, selective breeding and modern agricultural practices may have altered the composition of seed microbiomes, leading to the loss of key microbial partners. By analyzing bacterial communities from 54 Cannabis genotypes, I investigated the phylogenetic diversity, abundance, and network interactions of both cultured and uncultured seed endophytes.

My findings reveal that while culture-based methods successfully recovered bacteria from five major classes — Gammaproteobacteria, Bacilli, Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidia — this fraction represented only 6.3% of the total microbiota. Despite this low diversity, cultured taxa accounted for 89.2% of the microbial abundance, indicating that dominant bacterial groups are more readily culturable, while rare and phylogenetically distinct taxa remain elusive. Among these uncultured groups were Acidobacteriae and Verrucomicrobiae, both associated with plant growth-promoting traits but absent from cultivated isolates.

To understand why certain microbes resist cultivation, I conducted network analyses of microbial interactions. These revealed that uncultured taxa were more central within the seed microbiome, forming highly connected hubs with other uncultured bacteria. This suggests that microbial dependencies—such as nutrient exchange, signaling molecules, or symbiotic relationships—may play a crucial role in culturability. If these microbes rely on interactions with other species for survival, standard isolation techniques may be insufficient to recover them.

By refining cultivation strategies we can work toward recovering ecologically significant bacteria with potential applications in agriculture. This research not only highlights the limitations of current culturing methods but also provides a framework for future microbiome-informed breeding strategies and plant health management. Understanding the interplay between cultured and uncultured bacteria will be key to unlocking the full potential of seed-associated microbes, with implications for both sustainable Cannabis cultivation and broader agricultural systems. -->
